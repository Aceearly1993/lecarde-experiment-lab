This section has two purposes:
1) to experiment various improvements meant to be on Lecarde 2 Reworked edition (https://github.com/katriellucas/lecarde-2) but conflicts to original designer's idea.
2) to get around some limits of mainstream file hostage services, which are ususally not too kind towards underground games like Lecarde 2 and often get into torubles and confusions when discussing WIP progress
